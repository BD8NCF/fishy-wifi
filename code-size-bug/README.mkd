There seems to be a hard limit on code size that
NodeMCU can currently support. If we try to load a
chunk that exceeds that size then the system restarts.

To replicate, copy the files sizebug100.lua and sizebug300.lua
to the ESP. Then

    sb = require("sizebug100.lua")

This will succeed. Then try

    sb = require("sizebug300.lua")

This will trigger a reboot...

Test environment: 

- latest NodeMCU from github as of Jan 13 2015 16:22:01
- Ubuntu 14.04
- ESP-01 module
- ESPlorer build 206
