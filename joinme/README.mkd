JoinMe: a wifi config utility for the ESP8366 based on NodeMCU

Implementation notes
- init.lua does nothing apart from loading code (which in turn does nothing
  apart from define packages).
- Then there's a top-level `doinit()` function which is the main loop.
- No globals except package tables and `doinit()` itself.
